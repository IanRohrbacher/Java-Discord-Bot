# Java Discord Bot
Early experiment: a simple Discord bot written in Java
>*Created, ran, and tested on Eclipse IDE*


## Overview
In early 2022, a friend asked if I could make a Discord bot, so I made one using Java's net.dv8tion.jda. This was my first attempt at a Discord bot and is not actively maintained.


## Getting started
### Installing
Download all files and run in your preferred jave IDE

### Running
> [!WARNING]
> **I have no idea if this still works!**
- You must create a discord bot key and paste at /Keys.java; discordKey. You can create keys [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- You also need a sql key. *I don't remember how I used sql*


## Features
The sql was used as a inventory for users and the command where made to edit the data base.
